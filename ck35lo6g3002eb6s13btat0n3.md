Automating tasks that re-occur is definitely at the heart of every software developer. Google Cloud Platform has a tool that allows users to schedule jobs while maintaining the usual unix-cron format.  
Cloud Scheduler can be referred to as *Cronjob as a Service* tool, it is fully managed by Google Cloud Platform so you don't need to manage the scheduler's underlying infrastructure.

Cloud Scheduler can be used for multiple use cases such as making requests to an HTTP/S Endpoint, invoking a Pub/Sub topic, making database updates and push notifications, triggering CI/CD pipelines, scheduling tasks such as image uploads and sending an email, or even invoking Cloud Functions.  
In this article, we would simply use Cloud Scheduler to make simple requests to an HTTP Endpoint.

Cloud Scheduler can also be used with Firebase Cloud Functions which automatically configures Cloud Scheduler, along with a Pub/Sub topic, that invokes the function that you define using the Cloud Functions for Firebase SDK.  [Read more
