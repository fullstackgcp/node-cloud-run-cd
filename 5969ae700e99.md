## Kubernetes on GKE : Series Intro


> In this series of articles, you would learn how to setup and deploy applications to a [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)) cluster using the [Google Cloud Marketplace](https://cloud.google.com/marketplace), [Kubectl CLI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/), [Helm Charts](https://helm.sh/) and [Garden.io](http://garden.io/) tool.

_Although this article is based on containers, I would not be talking about Containers, feel free to read up_ [_Robert John’s article on What Are Docker Containers_](/@robertjohn_15390/what-are-docker-containers-d1d89739484e)_.
This is just meant to enable you get running with GKE as fast as possible.
Other articles in the series would guide you into multiple ways of deploying and managing applications to the GKE cluster you will be creating soon._

> _Kubernetes (commonly know as k8s) is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling, and management. It aims to provide a “platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts”.
> It works with a range of container tools, including Docker. —_ [_Wiki_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes)
> 
> For an overview of Kubernetes concepts, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/).
> 
> [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) (GKE) provides a managed environment for deploying, managing, and scaling your containerized applications using Google infrastructure. The Kubernetes Engine environment consists of multiple machines (specifically [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute) instances) grouped together to form a [container cluster](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/cluster-architecture).

## Prerequisites

*   Create a [Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project](https://console.cloud.google.com/project), or use an existing one.
*   Enable the [Kubernetes Engine API](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/container.googleapis.com/overview).
*   [Install GCloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install)

# Cluster Orchestration with Kubernetes Engine

Kubernetes Engine clusters are powered by the [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) open source cluster management system. Kubernetes provides the mechanisms through which you interact with your container cluster. You use Kubernetes commands and resources to deploy and manage your applications, perform administration tasks and set policies, and monitor the health of your deployed workloads.

When you run a Kubernetes Engine cluster on GKE, you also gain the benefit of advanced cluster management features that Google Cloud Platform provides. These include:

*   [Load-balancing](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing-and-autoscaling) for Compute Engine instances.
*   [Node Pools](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/node-pools) to designate subsets of nodes within a cluster for additional flexibility.
*   [Automatic scaling](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/cluster-autoscaler) of your cluster’s node instance count.
*   [Automatic upgrades](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/node-auto-upgrade) for your cluster’s node software.
*   [Node auto-repair](https://google.qwiklabs.com/focuses/Node%20auto-repair%5D(https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/node-auto-repair) to maintain node health and availability.
*   [Logging and Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/logging) with Stackdriver for visibility into your cluster.

# Creating a Kubernetes Engine cluster

A GKE [cluster](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/cluster-architecture) consists of at least one _cluster master_ machine and multiple worker machines called _nodes_. Nodes are [Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instances](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/) that run the Kubernetes processes necessary to make them part of the cluster.

_To setup a GKE cluster,_ [_click here_](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/add) _OR navigate as follows on the GCP Console:_ **_Kubernetes Engine > Clusters > Create Cluster_** _(name:_ **_my-cluster_**_, leave other fields as is)_

_If you are more comfortable using the gcloud tool, the equivalent command for the above is below._ _Do ensure that you have a default_ **_project_** _&_ **_zone_** _configured._


```
gcloud container clusters create my-cluster
```


*Your cluster should be created in a couple of minutes, and now you would learn how to deploy applications to the GKE cluster from  [Google Cloud Marketplace](https://fullstackgcp.com/deploying-ready-apps-to-gke-using-cloud-marketplace-4353ea499546) , [ Kubectl CLI](#)  &  [Helm Charts](#) .*
