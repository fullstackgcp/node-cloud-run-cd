## Development to Production on GKE Clusters using Garden

> In this article, we’ll develop and deploy apps onto a remote Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster using Garden.

> [Garden](https://garden.io) is a developer tool that automates your workflows and makes developing, testing and deploying Kubernetes applications faster and easier than ever.
> 
> [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) (GKE) provides a managed environment for deploying, managing, and scaling your containerized applications running on Kubernetes clusters using Google infrastructure.

## Before you begin:

1.  Create a [Google Cloud Platform (GCP) **project**](https://console.cloud.google.com/project), or use an existing one.
2.  Ensure you have **gcloud** installed, following the steps [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk).
3.  If you haven’t, follow the steps [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) to install **kubectl**.
4.  Clone the source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/Timtech4u/flask-docker).

# Garden Features

Garden has so many awesome features, I’ll be listing just a few, you can click [here](https://github.com/garden-io/garden#features) for more.

*   Develop and iterate as quickly with remote clusters as you do locally, and share development clusters with your team. With remote clusters you can even run Garden without Kubernetes or Docker installed on your machine!
*   Hot reload lets you near-instantaneously update code and static files in containers as they run, for services that support in-place reloading.
*   The built-in web dashboard gives you a full overview of your stack (and many more UI features are planned to further aid with development).
*   Build, test and deploy Docker containers, Helm charts, OpenFaaS functions and more.

# GKE Features

Google Kubernetes Engine has some great features for Developer to Operators to System Administrators, you can get details [here](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine).

*   [Load-balancing](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing-and-autoscaling) for Compute Engine instances.
*   [Node Pools](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/node-pools) to designate subsets of nodes within a cluster for additional flexibility.
*   [Automatic scaling](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/cluster-autoscaler) of your cluster’s node instance count.
*   [Automatic upgrades](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/node-auto-upgrade) for your cluster’s node software.
*   [Node auto-repair](https://google.qwiklabs.com/focuses/Node%20auto-repair%5D(https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/node-auto-repair) to maintain node health and availability.
*   [Logging and Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/logging) with Stackdriver for visibility into your cluster.

# Garden setup

To install Garden locally, run the following command:


```
curl -sL https://get.garden.io/install.sh | bash

```


![1.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1585189844918/cyH8--MY7.png)

If you’ll be working with a local kubernetes cluster, you’ll need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) and [Kubernetes](https://docs.garden.io/guides/local-kubernetes).

# GKE cluster setup

Ensure you have a GCP project created already. If you are a first time GCP user, you can get $300 credit for free to explore Google Cloud products [here](https://cloud.google.com/free/).

Login to gcloud using the command below, this would open a browser window for you to login. You could also set a default project after login.


```
gcloud auth login
```



![2.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1585189857163/IeTVq4Uwf.png)

_To setup a GKE cluster,_ [_click here_](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/add) _OR navigate as follows on the GCP Console:_ **_Kubernetes Engine > Clusters > Create Cluster_**

I’ll be creating a cluster with name: **my-dev-cluster** Feel free to use other configuration options as you wish.

Alternatively, you create the cluster with the gcloud command below:


```
gcloud container clusters create my-dev-cluster
```


![3.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1585189893807/qX844oQic.png)

Find the created cluster [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list), click on **connect** and copy the command.
This would help you get authentication credentials, which configures kubectl and allows you to manage the cluster, also ensure that your terminal has both [**kubectl**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) and [**gcloud**](https://cloud.google.com/sdk) installed. The following is my own connection command:


```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials my-dev-cluster --zone us-central1-c
```

_One of Garden’s most powerful features is the ability to build images in your Kubernetes development cluster, do ensure that your cluster has the minimum requirements as specified_ [_here_](https://docs.garden.io/guides/in-cluster-building#requirements)_._

# Garden configuration to remote GKE cluster

The first step to using Garden is to create a project. You can use the `garden create project` helper command, or manually create a `garden.yml` file in the root directory of your project.

Garden is configured via `garden.yml` configuration files. The [project-wide](/guides/configuration-files) `garden.yml` file should be located in the top-level directory of the project's Git repository.

We’ll be using multiple modules in the same configuration file, this is possible by using a document separator (`---`) between the module definitions.
Learn more about Garden configuration files [here](https://docs.garden.io/guides/configuration-files).

Below is my Garden configuration file, you can find it on GitHub gist [here](https://gist.github.com/Timtech4u/cd609a696f56a5df949c6e86370f6a91).

```
# garden.yml
kind: Project
name: flask-app
environments:
- name: dev
  providers:
  - name: kubernetes
    context: gke_fullstackgcp_us-central1-c_my-dev-cluster
    buildMode: cluster-docker
defaultEnvironment: dev

---

kind: Module
name: backend
description: My App Backend
type: container
services:
  # Service provides a running instance of your module.
  - name: backend
    ports:
      - name: http
        containerPort: 8080
```

_Change_ **_gke_fullstackgcp_us-central1-c_my-cluster_** _to your cluster’s context name. To get yours, execute the command:_ `**_kubectl config view_**`

The configuration is for a simple container module. We assume that the the Dockerfile and source files are in the same directory as the `garden.yml` file.

A module can correspond to a Dockerfile and its associated code, a remote Docker image, a Helm chart, an OpenFaaS function, and more, all depending on the module type.

Garden includes a `container` module type, which provides a high-level abstraction around container-based services, that's easy to understand and use. Learn more about Garden container modules [here](https://docs.garden.io/guides/container-modules).

Once you have ensured you have a **_Dockefile_** and your **_garden.yml_** configuration which connects to your GKE cluster using it’s context name.
You need to initialize the cluster-wide system services, before deploying to this cluster, do so by executing the following command:


```
**garden — env=dev plugins kubernetes cluster-init**
```


Now you can start an iterative development on the GKE cluster which watches your project for changes then re-builds and re-deploys, with the command:


```
garden dev
```


![5.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1585189998464/8xSKtpiI-.png)


This builds and deploys the Docker image for `backend` service. While it runs, you can go ahead and make a change to any of the files in the project, Garden would trigger rebuild and redeploy automatically. The changes will be reflected when you reload the forwarded localhost url.

To deploy services, which also builds modules and dependencies if needed, run the command:


```
garden deploy
```
