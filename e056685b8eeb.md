## Deploy to Cloud Run using GitLab CI


> In this article, I would guide through deploying serverless containerized applications to [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run), using [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) and [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build).

> _Cloud Run is a managed compute platform that enables you to run stateless serverless containers that automatically scales._
> 
> Cloud Build is a service that executes your builds on Google Cloud Platform infrastructure.
> 
> GitLab CI service is a part of GitLab that build and test the software whenever developer pushes code to application repo.

# Prerequisites

*   Create a [Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project](https://console.cloud.google.com/project), or use an existing one.
*   Create a [GitLab Repo](https://gitlab.com/projects/new).
*   Enable the [Cloud Run API](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/run.googleapis.com/overview).
*   Enable the [Cloud Build API](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds).
*   Clone the [_sample_ codes](https://gitlab.com/Timtech4u/vue-cloudrun) or setup your own codes with a _Dockerfile_.

# Creating a Service Account for Google Cloud Build

*   On Google Cloud, navigate through **Cloud Build > Settings.**
*   Under **Service account permissions,** ensure that **Cloud Run & Service Accounts** are **ENABLED** , this allows you deploy to Cloud Run.

*   Since I have given Cloud Build sufficient permissions, I can create a Cloud Build service account on **IAM & Admin > Service Accounts.** I’ll create a service account (NAME[@](http://twitter.com/custom)PROJECT.iam.gserviceaccount.com) and give it the _Cloud Build Service Agent._ On the created service account page, click on **Add Key > JSON**.

Service account page after creation of key

# Configure GitLab CI to use Service Accounts

On the GitLab repo, navigate through **Setting > CI/CD > Variables.**

**GitLab Repo Setting > CI/CD > Variables**

As seen above, I created a variable for **_GCP_PROJECT_ID_** whose value is the Google Cloud Project ID and **_GCP_SERVICE_KEY_** whose value is the contents of the JSON service account earlier created.

# Continuous Deployment to Cloud Run

With just some few steps left, my application would be continuously deployed to Cloud Run directly from our GitLab repo.

My [application](https://gitlab.com/Timtech4u/vue-cloudrun) also has a Dockerfile which is configured to run on port 8080 (the default port for Cloud Run).

Finally, I created a **_cloudbuild.yaml_** file which contains the commands to build & deploy by Cloud Build and **.gitlab-ci.yml** file which triggers the deployment processes when code is pushed.

Here’s a preview of my Cloud Build CI file:

```yaml
# File: cloudbuild.yaml
steps:
    # build the container image
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
    args: [ 'build', '-t', 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/demo-app', '.' ]
    # push the container image
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
    args: [ 'push', 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/demo-app']
    # deploy to Cloud Run
  - name: "gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud"
    args: ['run', 'deploy', 'erp-ui', '--image', 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/demo-app', '--region', 'europe-west4', '--platform', 'managed', '--allow-unauthenticated']
```

Here’s a preview of my GitLab CI file:

```yaml
# File: .gitlab-ci.yml
image: docker:latest

stages:
  - deploy

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  image: google/cloud-sdk
  services:
    - docker:dind
  script:
    - echo $GCP_SERVICE_KEY > gcloud-service-key.json # Google Cloud service accounts
    - gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file gcloud-service-key.json
    - gcloud config set project $GCP_PROJECT_ID
    - gcloud builds submit . --config=cloudbuild.yaml
```
